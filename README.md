# Polkadot Standards Proposals (PSPs)


A Polkadot Standards Proposal (PSP) describes standards and improvements for the Polkadot ecosystem. The Polkadot Standards Proposal GitHub is a community-based initiative.  

## PSPs Work Flow

Below is the workflow of a successful PSP:
```
1. Draft -> 2. Call for Feedback -> 3. Accepted -> 4. Integrated
```
1. **Draft:** A first draft, which is merged into this repo and actively improved together with the community. 
2. **Call for Feedback:** The PSP will be shared on different channels for additional feedback for at least 2 weeks. The result of this step is either an acceptance of the standard (->Accepted) or the rejection (->Draft). 
3. **Accepted:** Any further changes are unlikely, and developers can start integrating the PSP. Once a PSP is accepted, a reference implementation needs to be created.    
4. **Integrated:** The PSP is actively used and a reference implementation exists. . 

## Contributing PSPs

Before you start writing a formal PSP, you should discuss an idea in the various community channels. A PSP should provide the motivation as well as a technical specification for the feature. 

1. Fork this repository.
2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the template.
3. Fill out the [template](./psp-template.md) with the details of your PSP.
4. Once you have completed the application, click on "create new pull request".
